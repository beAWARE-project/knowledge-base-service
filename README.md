# knowledge-base-service
The Knowledge Base Service (KBS) interacts with most beAWARE system components to store system information. It also performs semantic reasoning to uncover underlying knowledge from data.



Add file "bus_credentials.json" into KBS folder and modify file "webgenesis_credentials.json" with the correct username and password.

Run the file "kb_service.py" with python3 for the KBS to start.
