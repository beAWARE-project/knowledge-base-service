# knowledge-base-service
The Knowledge Base Service (KBS) interacts with most beAWARE system components to store system information. It also performs semantic reasoning to uncover underlying knowledge from data.



Add file "bus_credentials.json" and "webgenesis_credentials.json" into "knowledge-base-service" 
file with the correct values. See dummies in dummy_credentials folder. 

Run the file "kb_service.py" with python3 for the KBS to start.
